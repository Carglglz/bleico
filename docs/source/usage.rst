time the connection was checked. If the device is disconnected, a desktop
notification will appear. Bleico will try to reconnect immediately, and if it
fails, bleico will try to reconnect every 30 seconds until it can connect again.
If the connection is successful a desktop notification will appear, and bleico
will return to normal operation.
